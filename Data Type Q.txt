20 DATA TYPES INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

1)What are Data Types?
:  A data type is a set of values and a set of operations defined on data. An implementation of a 
data type is an expression of data and operations in terms of a specific programming language such as Java, C ++, or Python.

2)what are the immutable types of Data types?
:  Strings and tuples.
 
3)what are mutable types of data types?
:  lists, dictionaries, and sets.

4)give examples of all data types?
Numbers:	1234(integer),  3.1415(float),  3+4j(complex no's type)
Strings:	‘spam’, “Bob’s”, b’a\x01c’,
Lists:	        [1, [2, ‘three’], 4.5]
Dictionaries:	{‘food’: ‘spam’, ‘taste’: ‘yum’}
Tuples: 	(1, ‘spam’, 4, ‘U’)
Sets:   	set(‘abc’), {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’}

5)Why are these data types known as Python’s core data types?
: They are known as the core data types because they are part of the Python language itself and are always available
  to create other objects, you usually need to call functions in imported modules.
  Most of the data types have a specific syntax for generating objects: “spam”, for example, is an expression that creates a string and
  determines the set of operations that can be applied to it. For this reason, 
  main types are built into Python syntax. Instead, you must call the built-in open function to create a file object.

6)What does immutable mean and what three types of Python core data types are considered immutable?
:  An immutable data type is a type of object which cannot be modified after its creation. Numbers, strings, 
   and tuples in Python fall into this category. Although you cannot modify an immutable object in place, you can always create a new one by running an expression.

7)What does sequence mean and which three types of data fall into this category?
:    A sequence data type is a collection of objects ordered by a specific position. In Python, Strings, lists, and tuples are the data types based on sequences.
    The Sequences share common sequence operations, such as indexing, concatenation, and slicing, but also have type-specific method calls.




8)What does mapping mean and what kind of data type is based on mapping?
:   The term mapping refers to an object that maps keys to associated values. The Python dictionary is the only type of mapping in the base typeset.
   Mappings do not maintain any left-to-right position order; they support access to stored data by key, as well as type-specific method calls.


9)What is polymorphism and why should you care?
:   Polymorphism means that the meaning of an operation (like a+) depends on the objects being operated. This turns out to be a key idea behind good use of Python,
   not coercing code to specific types makes that code automatically applied to many types.

10)Python Data Types
:   Numeric data types: int, float, complex.
   String data types:   str.
   Sequence types:      list, tuple, range.
   Binary types:        bytes, bytearray, memoryview.
   Mapping data type:   dict.
   Boolean type:        bool.
   Set data types:      set, frozenset. 
   Python Numeric Data Type. Python numeric data type is used to hold numeric values like;

11)To store values as regards key and value we use
:  Dictionary

12)What type of error can arises when you execute the following code x = y?
:  NameError

13)where is indexing is not possible in data types like?
:  set and dict

14)What will be the output of the following code:
a = 1
b = 1
print(id(a) == id(b))
: True



15)What is a list?
Answer:
A list is an in-built Python data structure that can be changed. 
It is an ordered sequence of elements and every element inside the list may also be called an item. By ordered sequence, 
it is meant that every element of the list can be called individually by its index number. The elements of a list are enclosed in square brackets[ ].

16)list1 = [”h”,”e”,”I”,”p”]. What would be the output for list1 [-2] and list1 [-5]?
Answer:
list1 [-2] = T
list1 [-5] will generate IndexError: list index out of range
Similar to Strings, the slice operator can also be used on the list. So, if the range given is [a:b]. 
It would mean that all elements from index a to index b will be returned. [a:b:c] would mean all the elements from index a to index b, with stride c.

17)list1 =[1,2,78,45,93,56,34,23,12,98,70]
list1[6:9]=[2,2,2]
What is the new value of list1?
Answer:
[1,2, 78, 45, 93, 56, 2, 2, 2, 98, 70]


18)list1 =[1,2, 78, 45, 93, 56, 34, 23, 12, 98, 70, 65]
list1 +=[87]
What is the value of list1?
Answer:
[1, 2, 78, 45, 93, 56, 34, 23, 12, 98, 70, 65, 87]


19)list1 =[1,2, 78, 45, 93, 56, 34, 23, 12, 98, 70, 65]
list1 -=[65]
What will be the output?
Answer:
The output will be TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: ‘list’ and ‘list’


20)When would you prefer to use a tup1e or a list?
Answer:
tup1es and lists can be used for similar situations but tup1es are generally preferred for the collection of heterogeneous data types 
whereas lists are considered for homogeneous data types. Iterating through a tup1e is faster than iterating through a list.
tup1es are ideal for storing values that you don’t want to change. 
Since tup1es are immutable, the values within are write-protected.
